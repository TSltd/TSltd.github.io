<p>110/220VAC Opto-Isolated Zero Cross Detector Module for DIN Rail Carrier Mount with 3.3V or 5V Output - Ideal for Arduino, ESP32/ESP8266</p>
<p>This module detects the zero cross point of an AC supply and outputs a 3.3V or 5V square wave signal pulse of 1ms every time the zero point is crossed. For a 50Hz supply this pulse would be sent 100 times per second. This is ideal for micro-controller projects which require accurate synchronization with the AC supply, such as for controlling triacs to perform phase-angle control for light dimming or heater control. The AC side of the circuit is optically isolated from the DC side, providing important safety and protection for the micro-controller.</p>

        <p><img src="./images/render7cropped.jpg"width="600" height=auto alt="image"></p>
        
<p>The AC supply is connected to the upper terminal block, and the lower terminal block is connected to the micro-controller, sharing its DC 3.3V or 5V and ground, and sending the output signal to a designated GPIO pin to trigger an interrupt in the code.</p>
<p>The board features a micro-LED indicator and is designed fit into a <a href="https://www.camdenboss.com/camden-boss/cimemsef1125s-72mm-empty-modular-interface-support%2c-11.25mm-end-section-with-foot/c-23/p-18378">Camdenboss DIN rail enclosure</a> for easy mounting.</p>
<p>This module adds to the growing number of DIN rail based accessories for micro-controller projects, enabling a &#39;plug and play&#39; approach to speed up project-building.</p>

 

        
<p>CAUTION- This circuit uses mains AC voltage which is hazardous and can cause ELECTRIC SHOCK or FIRE. It must be independently reviewed and certified by a qualified professional before use. The designer accepts no responsibility for assembly or use of this module in any way.</p>
